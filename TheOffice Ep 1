========================

The Pam adn Jim Saga Part 1

Bm                   A     
Jim's got this huge crush on pam
G                         F#
which she continues to ignore
cos she's engaged to this other guy
but no one knows what fooor

C                      
Then one night after 2 whole seasons 
he goes and tells her whats up and they kiss
Pam's still like "No" for some twisted reason
and Roy later greets Jim with his fist

E                A             
But soon after, Jim leaves scranton 
        G                      F#
and hes back with karen by his side
Its fair to say that pam didnt like her
and she moans about it for a while

But Karen leaves just as quickly as she came
and now Jim and pam are together atlast
But between this guy this and that 
who really knows how long they will last
